# Traveler

When going on a trip, whether a long or short one, it is often a good idea to plan out your events to maximize your time on that trip. This app will allow a user a more convenient way to better visualize and organize how they spend their time on their trip. Features included would be flight reminders, a search feature to view things such as hotels, local events and activities, etc., a budgeting feature to help a user manage and track expenses, and many more. Using the app will make planning and navigating a trip a breeze.

## Milestone 1

Milestone 1: The goal is to finish the trip registration feature. At the end of it, we need the user to be able to enter all required information about the trip and the app to be able to display it.

Users can add trips by filling out date/time for several categories, including separate data types like Flight and Hotel. Most of the flow has been tested and works properly. Submitting data correctly prints the information as a tile.

NOTE: Casey worked with Henry (Haonan) on testing, so any committs he submitted were from both of them.
