# Traveler

When going on a trip, whether a long or short one, it is often a good idea to plan out your events to maximize your time on that trip. This app will allow a user a more convenient way to better visualize and organize how they spend their time on their trip. Features included would be flight reminders, a search feature to view things such as hotels, local events and activities, etc., a budgeting feature to help a user manage and track expenses, and many more. Using the app will make planning and navigating a trip a breeze.
